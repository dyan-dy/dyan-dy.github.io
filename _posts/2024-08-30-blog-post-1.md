🌱 During the activities of the Sanjiangyuan Environmental Network Project, the Yushu Vocational Training School and entrepreneurs shared their stories, which were full of strength and inspiration. In subsequent policy dialogues, various departments adopted a comprehensive approach to deepen the understanding of the issue. Through methods such as text analysis, data statistics, and field research, the audience gained a clearer understanding of how different departments position themselves in cooperation and dialogue. This multi-dimensional research approach not only enhanced the scientific and targeted nature of policy-making but also provided a solid foundation for interdepartmental collaboration. These efforts pave the way for more effective outcomes in environmental protection and climate change response.

🌐 The event explored the various challenges and opportunities in green transformation and integrated the gender dimension into the problem framework. It comprehensively considered multiple scenarios, including emergency resource allocation during extreme weather disasters, local agricultural and pastoral labor, skill development and support in work-family balance, information access channels and educational guidance, emphasizing a people-centered approach. It also examined the integration of current policies, education, resource allocation, international communication, and new ideas, aiming to build a cross-issue platform that encourages collaboration between production and consumption ends and among different departments to jointly address climate change.

👏 Thanks to the meticulous planning by the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation (NCSC), the Environmental Planning Institute of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (CAEP), and UN Women, as well as the insightful contributions from experts from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the International Institute of Green Finance (IIGF) at Central University of Finance and Economics.
